## THIS IS A FORK ##

Please find the original, official repository on Applied Security's Github. 

This fork was made because AppSec is apparently uninterested in maintaining this plugin
on Pypi, and I happen to need it with Python3 support.

## original readme follows: ##

This Python module implements the binary protocol used by the collectd Network 
plugin to let you send arbitrary numeric data to collectd servers. Other than 
turning on the Network plugin on the destination collectd server, no 
configuration is needed.

Documentation may be found locally in the docs/ directory or online at
http://packages.python.org/collectd/
